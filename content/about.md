I’m Siem; on the internet, I most commonly assume the name *itssiem*.  
I’m a software developer and hobbyist in all things IT. During the waking 
hours of the day, I study [software engineering](https://www.windesheim.nl/opleidingen/voltijd/bachelor/hbo-ict-software-engineering-almere-en-zwolle) 
at [Windesheim University of Applied Science](https://windesheim.nl). When I’m 
not occupied with my studies, I like to tinker with all sorts of IT-related 
stuff. If you are interested in what I spend my time doing, you should check 
out my [projects page](projects).

Currently, I’m finishing my final year of my [HBO degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Netherlands#Vocational_education_and_higher_education) 
in software engineering. It has been a wonderful experience to be surrounded by 
so many people who love the same things as I do. I have had the privilege of 
working at Windesheim as a teaching assistant. I really enjoyed working 
together with the other TAs to develop interesting, impactful software that 
improves the quality of the education Windesheim provides.

As part of my HBO Bachelor at Windesheim, I’m following a pre-master program 
at the [University of Twente](https://utwente.nl). This program prepares me 
for the master's in computer science I wish to follow in the coming years.
