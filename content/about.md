So you found my website huh, I guess I should tell you who I am now.
I'm Siem on the internet I most commonly assume the name 'itssiem', I'm a 
software developer and hobbyist in all things IT.

Currently I'm finishing my final year of my [HBO Degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Netherlands#Vocational_education_and_higher_education)
in Software Engineering. It has been a wonderful experience to be surrounded by 
so many people who love the same things as I do.
