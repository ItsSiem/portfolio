Here is a quick list of projects I have done, some were for school and some 
just for fun.

## People Party
A fun frantic web based party game where players compete in rounds of 
minigames. 

This project was a great technical challenge and really forced us 
to think ahead and design our architechture very well. We got to use a lot of 
cool different technologies like C++, WebSockets, Flatbuffers and ofcourse some 
crazy TypeScript shananigans.

## Time-n-Time
A simple visual segmented timer app. The differently colored segments clearly 
communicate the duration of several timers in a glance. It is used in classrooms 
at primary schools.

## Shitty Site Generator
When I decided to make this website I originally wanted to just use some run 
of the mill framework with some pretty template and call it a day. However when 
trying to use one of these frameworks I came to the realization that I really 
did not need any of it's cool features. So I decided to try to make my own 
simple static site generator for this website.

The goal was simple: I want to be able to write the pages in MarkDown and it 
shouldn't be too much work to add new pages. With this goal in mind I wrote a 
simple bash script and whipped up some basic HTML and CSS, the result? You are 
looking at it right now.
